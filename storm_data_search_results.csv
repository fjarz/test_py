Greatest impacts were in the Coconut Grove area where inundation ranged from 3 to 5 feet at the shoreline, with inland extent of flooding up to the north side of Bayshore Drive. Marinas and parks at the bayfront were flooded, and adjacent properties/structures suffered water damage as far south as Matheson Hammock Park.  ||USGS rapid deployment gauges measured a maximum storm tide of 5.75 feet above NAVD88 at Dinner Key Marina in Coconut Grove, 5.61 feet above NAVD88 at Black Point, and 4.07 feet above NAVD88 at Turkey Point. At the Virginia Key NOS station, maximum storm tide was 3.66 feet above MHHW. ||In the Brickell area just south of Downtown Miami, streets within a half-mile of the bay had about 2-3 feet of inundation. Similar inundation was noted north of Downtown Miami up to the Edgewater area, with lower values to the north. ||Along the Atlantic coast from Miami Beach northward, inundation was generally 2-3 feet along the immediate coast, with a maximum storm tide from USGS gauge of 3.32 feet above NAVD88 at Bal Harbour.","Major Hurricane Irma made landfall in Southwest Florida on Marco Island as a Category 3 hurricane around 330 PM EDT on September 10th. The storm traveled north through southwest Florida through the evening. Effects from Irma were felt across South Florida from September 9th through September 11th. Irma had reached Category 5 strength and a minimum central pressure of 914 MB east of the Bahamas, maintaining Category 5 intensity until landfall along the north coast of Cuba on September 9th. Irma made its first Florida landfall in the Lower Florida Keys early on September 10th as a Category 4 hurricane. ||The strength and size of Hurricane Irma allowed for impacts to be felt across all of South Florida. Irma brought widespread wind damage, heavy rainfall and storm surge to all areas. Hurricane-force sustained wind were measured in much of Collier County, as well as far southern and inland Miami-Dade County, with the possibility of additional hurricane-force sustained wind in more isolated areas over the remainder of South Florida where widespread tropical storm force sustained wind occurred. Gusts to hurricane force were felt over all of South Florida, with the maximum measured wind gust of 142 mph in Naples in Collier County. Widespread tree damage and some structural damage occurred across all of South Florida, with most structural damage on the minor side.||Irma brought a significant storm surge on both coasts of South Florida. Storm surge of 6 to 8 feet was observed in the Everglades City and Goodland areas of Collier County, with 3 to 5 feet from Marco Island to Naples. Along the east coast, observed storm surge values of 4 to 6 feet were noted along Biscayne Bay from south of Miami to Homestead, and 2 to 4 feet elsewhere along the east coast from Key Biscayne to Palm Beach.||Hurricane Irma brought widespread rainfall and some flooding across the region. From the period between 8 AM EDT September 9th and 8 AM EDT September 11th, 8 to 15 inches of rain were measured over interior portions of Southwest Florida, with estimated amounts of 16 to 20 inches in southwestern Hendry County. This rainfall near the end of a wet summer led to significant flooding over these areas. 5 to 10 inches of rain were noted elsewhere across South Florida, with areas of minor to moderate flooding. ||32 deaths were attributed to Irma in southern Florida, all but one indirect.
